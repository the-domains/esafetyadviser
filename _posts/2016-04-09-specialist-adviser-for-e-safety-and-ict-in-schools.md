description: "Hello, I'm Alan Mackenzie. e-Safety has been a passion of mine for a very long time; I love technology and the huge benefits that can be realised through global connectivity and collaboration. I'm a strong believer that e-safety is an enabler, not a showstopper; it should never be a barrier to innovative use of technology."
